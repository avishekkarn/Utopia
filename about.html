                <p>
                    Welcome to Utopia! I'm <strong>Avishek Karn</strong>, a passionate poet and computer science student.
                    My journey into poetry started as a way to express emotions, capture fleeting moments, 
                    and translate thoughts into meaningful verses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poetry, to me, is not just wordsâ€”it's a rhythm of life. Whether it's about love, hope, 
                    or deep reflections, every poem I write is a piece of my soul woven into words.
                </p>
